# Java-Dynamic-Website
Using Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers in conjunction with Servlet technologies to create a dynamic website. Specifically used, the Apache TomcatÂ® software (version 7). Which is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies.


### Features
- JSP page with a submit button that redirects to a new page that is embedded in the servlet doGet function
- The servlet doGet function ouputs a hello message and the current timestamp

### Issues ran into
